To install an ubuntu system-image to a device, you need a cdimage rootfs
tarball for ubuntu touch devices (you can create the tarball with the
rootstock-touch tool shipped along with the rootstock-touch-installer
script or you can directly download one from:

http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-touch/daily-preinstalled/current/trusty-preinstalled-touch-armhf.tar.gz

Additionally to the ubuntu rootfs you need an android system.img which
will be used for the lxc container that provides the hardware abstraction
layer used by ubuntu touch. This tarball is usually created by building
the android tree for your device based on the git tree from
http://phablet.ubuntu.com (please see the porting guide at
https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Touch/Porting for details on creating andorid
images for your device.)

Make sure you have the android-tools-adb and android-tools-fsutils
packages installed before running rootsotck-touch-install

Once you have both files available run rootsotck-touch-install like:

./rootsotck-touch-install ./trusty-prtrusty-preinstalled-touch-armhf.tar.gz ./system.img

(the above example assumes you have both files in the rootstock-ng tree)

rootstock-touch-install knows an option to keep the userdata
(/home/phablet/) untouched, in case you only want to install a system
upgrade.

Note that by default everything gets wiped !.
